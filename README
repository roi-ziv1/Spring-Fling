## FEEDBACKS:
* The timer is not noticeable during the game -  changing the timer to bar
* No meaning for opponent - fewer flies and hitting the other player lowers drops him one point

## PLAYTEST
* The color of the frog is too similar to the leaf - change the color of the frog to blue
* Jumping to slowly - we increased the jump and deleted the energy system
